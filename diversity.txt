Good evening everyone.
i will be speaking on Diversity at workplace.

Diversity means the state of having people who are 
different races or who have different cultures in a 
group or organization.

As we will be working in an MNC like Capgemini 
which hires people accross the globe , we will get to meet 
and work with a lot of people of different origin,
Race,Ethnicity,Beliefs, culture, values etc.
When we will be working in the same environment it is our
duty to respect each other's culture and belifs.
for that we need to talk to our co-workers and try to
Keep An Open Mind and understand their cultures and values.
Help our coworkers Feel Comfortable Expressing Themselves.
We can also be part of Regular Culture Days/culuural activities 
organised by the company.
By following these few things we can encourage diversity
in  our organisation and make everyone feel like a part of 
the Family.
